# CarSafety Static Website
## This is a fictitious government website just for practices. Only front-end implemented at this stage. Feel free to use it as template.
### Technologies used in here:
1. Html with Css for the static page. Animations are achieved by Css (Can be done the same in Js).
2. JQuery for navigating back to the top with animations.
3. Framework Bootstrap 4 used in here.
4. Not really comments here, but the codes are neat and clean. Every div with a proper name.

### For the future work:
1. Back-end development, a Nosql(Mongo Db) database for recording enquires and vehicles safety information.
2. A live search function done by Ajax and Php.
3. A back-end management system supporting online modifing database.
